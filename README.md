<h2>Hi, I'm Emerson.</h2>

<p>Professionally, I'm proficent programmer generally and can hold my own on full stack web dev, scripting, data, or application buidling projects. Overall, I love to build things and create efficencies through technology in all fields. I don't shy away from learning new technologies and am pretty pragmatic when it comes to my tech stack.</p> 

<p>Currently I'm a full time software developer in the University of Utah human genetics department. Here I've been contributing to & developing web applications for bioinformatics research uses (check out: https://github.com/iobio).</p>

<p>In terms of personality, I'm generally a kind, fun to work with, and helpful teammate.</p>

<p>On a <i>slightly</i> less professional note, I'm a past human behavioral researcher with an academic interest artificial behavior <i>(ML/AI research)</i>. I'm interested in machine learning and AI broadly. However, because of my academic history I have a particular interest in reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

<h4>My Side Projects</h4>

- Research projects using <a href="https://github.com/emersonlebleu/PS_Model">projective simulation</a> to model derived/arbitrarily-applicable relational responding (DRR/AARR) and other findings in the human behavioral research space.
- Planning a conceptual paper outlining the implications of interlocking behavioral contingencies between biological and
artificial agents.
- A <i>"tour de papers"</i> where I implement ideas from seminal papers, from scratch, roughly following the taxonomy of machine learning field, from linear regression to transformer networks.

<h4>Interested in:</h4>

- Technology (Computer Science, Data Science, Programming, Machine Learning)
- Science (Psychology & Natural Sciences such as: Biology, Physics, Chemistry)
- Philosophy
- <i>Especially</i> the intersections of two or more of these. Always happy to talk about ideas from any of them.
