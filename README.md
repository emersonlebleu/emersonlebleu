<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Emerson. I'm a past human behavioral researcher now focused on artificial behavior (ML/AI Research). 
I'm interested in machine learning and AI broadly. However, because of my academic history I have a particular interest in reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

<p>While academic work and research is interesting to me I'm also a proficent programmer generally and can hold my own on full stack web dev, scripting, data, or application buidling projects. Overall, I love to build things and create efficencies through technology.</p>

Currently working on:
- Research projects using <a href="https://github.com/emersonlebleu/PS_Model">projective simulation</a> to model derived/arbitrarily-applicable relational responding (DRR/AARR) and
other findings in the human behavioral research space.
- Planning a conceptual paper outlining the implications of interlocking behavioral contengencies between biological and
artificial agents.
- A <i>"tour de papers"</i> where I implement ideas from seminal papers, from scratch, roughly following the taxonomy of machine learning field, from linear regression to transformer networks.

Interested in:
- Technology (Computer Science, Programming, Machine Learning)
- Behavioral Science (Psychology)
- Philosophy
- <i>Especially</i> the intersections of two or more of these. Always happy to talk about ideas from any of them.
