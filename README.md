<h2>Hi, I'm Emerson.</h2>

<p>I'm a software engineer with mostly full stack web development and bioinformatics related experience. Overall, I love to build things and create efficencies through technology in all fields. I don't shy away from learning new technologies and am pretty pragmatic when it comes to my tech stack.</p> 

<p>Currently I'm a full time software developer in the University of Utah human genetics department. Here I've been contributing to & developing web applications for bioinformatics research uses (check out: https://github.com/iobio). Generally, this means building things from idea to deployment independently or mostly independently + a small team.</p>

<h4>Interested in:</h4>

- Technology (Computer Science, Data Science, Programming, Machine Learning)
- Science (Psychology & Natural Sciences such as: Biology, Physics, Chemistry)
- Philosophy
- <i>Especially</i> the intersections of two or more of these. Always happy to talk about ideas from any of them.
