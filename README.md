<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Emerson. I'm a past human behavioral researcher academically interested in artificial behavior (ML/AI Research). 
I'm interested in machine learning and AI broadly. However, because of my academic history I have a particular interest in reinforcement learning techniques. While academic work and research is interesting to me personally. Professionally, I'm proficent programmer generally and can hold my own on full stack web dev, scripting, data, or application buidling projects. Overall, I love to build things and create efficencies through technology in all fields. I don't shy away from learning new technologies and am pretty pragmatic when it comes to my tech stack.</p>

Currently working on:
- A prompt engineering project from my consulting gig related to pulling information from web pages, processing, and getting reliable output from LLMs regarding the content.
- Research projects using <a href="https://github.com/emersonlebleu/PS_Model">projective simulation</a> to model derived/arbitrarily-applicable relational responding (DRR/AARR) and other findings in the human behavioral research space.
- Planning a conceptual paper outlining the implications of interlocking behavioral contingencies between biological and
artificial agents.
- A <i>"tour de papers"</i> where I implement ideas from seminal papers, from scratch, roughly following the taxonomy of machine learning field, from linear regression to transformer networks.

Interested in:
- Technology (Computer Science, Programming, Machine Learning)
- Science (Psychology & Natural sciences such as: Biology, Physics, Chemistry)
- Philosophy
- <i>Especially</i> the intersections of two or more of these. Always happy to talk about ideas from any of them.
