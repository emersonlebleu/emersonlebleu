<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>My name is <b>Emerson Lebleu</b>. I'm a behavioral researcher turned artificial behavior researcher. 
I'm interested in machine learning and AI broadly but with a specific academic interest in reinforcement learning techniques
because of my academic history.</p>

I'm currently working on:
- Research projects using <a href="https://github.com/emersonlebleu/PS_Model">projective simulation</a> to model derived/arbitrarily-applicable relational responding (DRR/AARR) and
other findings in the human behavioral research space.
- Planning a conceptual paper outlining the implications of interlocking behavioral contengencies between biological and
artificial agents.
- A <i>"tour de papers"</i> where I implement ideas from seminal papers from scratch roughly following the taxonomy of machine learning field, from linear regression to transformer networks.
